MySQL Learning Journey
Welcome to my MySQL learning repository, where I explore the core concepts and practical applications of SQL using MySQL. As a Data Analyst and Data Engineer with a foundation in software engineering and cloud data technologies (GCP), I’m expanding my on-premises and cloud-based data skills by mastering relational databases and query optimization through structured hands-on practice.

What You'll Find Here
This repo includes SQL scripts, notebooks, and example datasets focused on:
✅ Data querying and filtering (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY)
✅ Aggregation and grouping (GROUP BY, HAVING, aggregate functions)
✅ Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)
✅ Subqueries and nested SELECTs
✅ Window functions (ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), SUM() OVER)
✅ Data manipulation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
✅ Real-world problem-solving with analytics use cases

Tools & Tech
MySQL – Core SQL learning and exercises
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) – Background in BigQuery, Dataflow, and cloud-based pipelines
Python & Jupyter Notebooks – For integrating SQL with data analysis
